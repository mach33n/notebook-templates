This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
```{r}
#JUST COMMENTS
# This data set aims to measure the subscription rates of customers over time. Churn represents discontinuation of a product by a customer which is represented by a True value or 1 when it occurs for a customer. We wish to correlate this statistic with variabls such as basic customer information as well as calling and messaging rates and information.

Data Collection and Cleaning
```{r}
#Data Collection
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Blades/notebook-templates/master/python/Datasets/Churn_Data.csv")

#I want to fix the column name for Churn.
colnames(data)[which(names(data) == "Churn.")] <- "Churn"

#Now I would like to clean my Churn column values and make it a factor.
Churn <- data["Churn"]
Placeholder <- NULL
for (a in data$Churn){
  if (a == "False."){
    Placeholder <- c(Placeholder, "False")
  } else if(a == "True."){
    Placeholder <- c(Placeholder, "True")
  }else{
    Placeholder <- c(Placeholder, "None")
  }
}
data$Churn <- as.factor(Placeholder)
data
```
Data Partitioning
```{r}
#Partition Data into Sample test and train sets
# 50% sample size
smp_size <- floor(0.8 * nrow(data))

#Set seed 
set.seed(123)
train_data <- sample(1:nrow(data), nrow(data)/2)

train <- data[train_data,]
test <- data[-train_data,]

train
test
```

```{r}
# Attempt to make area code a factor for decision tree
unique(data$Area.Code)
data$Area.Code <- as.factor(data$Area.Code)

#Decision tree to analyze Churn in relation to suspected variables
#We eliminated calls as a variable having possible effect
frmla = data$Churn ~ data$CustServ.Calls + data$Area.Code + data$Account.Length + data$Int.l.Plan + data$VMail.Plan + data$Day.Calls + data$Day.Charge + data$Eve.Calls + data$Eve.Charge + data$Night.Calls + data$Night.Charge + data$Intl.Charge + data$Intl.Calls 
tree_model = tree(frmla, method = "class", data = train)

summary(tree_model)
plot(tree_model)
text(tree_model, pretty = 0)

#After analysis, we see that the only variable that have an effect are: Day.Charge, CusrServ.Calls, Int.l.Plan, Eve.Charge, VMail.Plan, Intl.Calls and Intl.Charge. International variable seem to be of interest in deciding the churning factor of customers.

```

```{r}
#Logistic Regression
frmla = data$Churn ~ data$CustServ.Calls + data$Int.l.Plan + data$VMail.Plan + data$Day.Charge + data$Eve.Charge + data$Intl.Charge + data$Intl.Calls 
model <- glm (frmla, data = train, family = binomial)
summary(model)

ggplot(train, aes(x=CustServ.Calls, y=Area.Code)) + geom_point() + 
stat_smooth(method="glm", family="binomial", se=FALSE)

#After plotting multiple Y-axes I can see there is no correlaiton relation among the variables found to hold importance in the decision tree models.
# I have found a weak positive correlation between area code and Customer service calls which could be of use. 

ggplot(train, aes(x=CustServ.Calls, y=Intl.Charge)) + geom_point() + 
stat_smooth(method="glm", family="binomial", se=FALSE)

#We also discovered a very weak negative correlation between International Charge and Customer Service Calls. However, no other variables showed any real important correlations.
```

```{r}
#Random Forests
frmla = data$CustServ.Calls ~ data$CustServ.Calls + data$Area.Code + data$Account.Length + data$Int.l.Plan + data$VMail.Plan + data$Day.Calls + data$Day.Charge + data$Eve.Calls + data$Eve.Charge + data$Night.Calls + data$Night.Charge + data$Intl.Charge + data$Intl.Calls + data$Area.Code
Random_Forest = randomForest(frmla, data = train)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
